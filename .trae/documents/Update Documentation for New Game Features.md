I will update `README.md` and `GAME_MANUAL.md` to reflect the latest game features, including the new Alchemy mini-game, expanded NPC interactions, and specific achievements.

### 1. Update `README.md`
- **Game Features**: Add **长生丹房 (Alchemy House)** to the list of facilities.
- **NPC System**: Update the description to highlight rich NPC storylines and interaction-specific achievements (e.g., helping with blueprints, haircuts, stealing from cats).
- **Todo List**: Mark "Rich Items & Inventory" and "More NPC Storylines" as partially completed or in-progress.

### 2. Update `GAME_MANUAL.md`
- **New Section: 游乐坊 (Entertainment District)**:
  - **长生丹房 (Alchemy)**: Describe the 2048-style herb merging gameplay.
  - **无宁箭馆 (Archery)**: Explain how martial arts attributes affect results.
  - **小司赌坊 (Gambling)**: Explain the dice betting mechanics.
  - **算命小摊 (Fortune)**: Mention daily fortune drawing.
- **NPC Interaction Rules**:
  - Add the **Daily Interaction Limit**: "Apart from chatting and gifting, you can interact with each NPC up to 5 times per day."
  - Mention **Hidden Storylines**: Interacting with NPCs (e.g., Baizhou, Luhua, Cat) triggers unique achievements and rewards.
- **UI/UX**:
  - Add a note about the **Dynamic Notification System** (Green for gains, Red for losses).

### 3. Verification
